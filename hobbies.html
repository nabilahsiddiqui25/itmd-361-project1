	<h2>Rubik's Cubes</h2>
	<p>I really enjoy playing & collecting with different kinds of Rubik's Cubes!</p>
	<h3>What is the Rubik's cube used for?</h3>
	<p>Rubik's Cube is a widely popular mechanical puzzle that has attracted attention around the world because of its unique characteristics. As a classic brain-training toy well known to the public, Rubik's Cube was used for scientific research and technology development by many scholars.</p>

	<h2>Sports</h2>
	<p>My favorite sports are:</p>
	<ul> 
		<li>Basketball</li>
		<li>Badminton</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Basketball</h3>
	<img src="media/basketball.png"alt = "bball">
	<p>Basketball is a game played between two teams of five players each on a rectangular court, usually indoors. Each team tries to score by tossing the ball through the opponent's goal, an elevated horizontal loop and net called a basket.</p>
	<h4>How to Play?</h4>
	<p>Each team tries to protect the goal on their side while making a goal on the opponent's side of the court. The opposite team tries to get the ball, take control of it while bouncing and tries to grab it while it is passed among the team mates to prevent a goal.</p>
	<h3>Badminton</h3>
	<img src = "media/badminton.png"alt = "badminton">
	<p>Badminton is a game played by two or four players on a rectangular court with a high net across the middle. The players try to score points by hitting a small object called a shuttlecock across the net using a racket. </p>
	<h4>How to Play?</h4>
	<p>Players score points by striking a shuttlecock with their racket so that it passes over the net and lands in their opponents' half of the court. A rally ends once the shuttlecock has struck the ground, and the shuttlecock may only be struck once by each side before it passes over the net.</p>
